# Incident Alarm

## It Works (kinda)
- analysis of live stream
- a form of message identification
- some of log testing

## Still left
- Extensive testing of live stream
- Most of log testing (file now missing)
- PCAP output?

## Time
- Redoing work lost from VM crash: 4 hours. Lesson learned: figure out how to install VM in the future.

## Questions
1. Are the heuristics used in this assignment to determine incidents "even that good"?  
Eh not really
2. If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to detecting incidents?  
I'd probably put more research into incidents not specified by the assignment, and see if my program had any known flaws and address them.
